# Crofters
Crofters: Your digital way of developing Agricultural resources is a mobile friendly app for Filipino Farmers to help them sell their local products. It consists of features such as bidding channels, direct contact with consumers, companies, LGU's, and partners to help them sell their crops at a much more reasonable price and gain the upper hand in every market transaction.   From here is our landing page to introduce this concept.

We use HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
